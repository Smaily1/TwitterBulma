My attempt to mimic Twitter using Rails (as BackEnd) and Bulma (as FrontEnd) frameworks.

## Ruby and Rails Versions:
- `Ruby 2.7.5`
- `Rails 5.2.7`
## How to use it  :

- Clon the project to your machine using the command:
````bash
git clone git@github.com:smaily1/twitterbulma.git
````
- Change the directory to the project by typing `twitterbulma` than install the gems by typing :
````bash
bundle install
````
- Migration step and creating tabels in your database :
````bash
rails db:migrate
````

- Finally run the server by typing the command :
````bash
rails server 
````
you will find your app working at `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes :
This is a sample MVP of the application, so it will look with only basic features without luxuries, I am currently trying to master UI design in order to make my applications look nicer.
> Any other suggestions I would be happy to add to the application. Thank you.
